# POD-JSON Roadmap

This document outlines planned and potential future improvements to the POD-JSON specification.

## v1.0.x (Patch Releases)

- Fix typos and clarify ambiguous field descriptions.
- Add more complete examples (hoodie, tote bag, mugs).
- Improve consistency in formatting and naming conventions.
- Expand guidance for AI-generated POD-JSON creation.

## v1.1.0 (Minor Release)

- Add optional product metadata (materials, GSM, fit).
- Extend print methods: DTF, screen printing, embroidery.
- Define recommended file delivery formats and resolution guidelines.
- Add `assets` section for referencing multiple images or attachments.
- Introduce standardized error codes for validation.

## v2.0.0 (Major Release)

- Support multi-item bundles and kits.
- Add modular product definitions for complex garments.
- Introduce routing rules for multi-location printing.
- Multi-currency pricing and tax breakdowns.
- Support for more product categories: posters, mugs, stickers.

## Open Questions

- Should POD-JSON define a standard URL structure for design assets?
- How to handle color profiles across different printers?
- Should AI prompt metadata be included for traceability?

## Long-Term Vision

POD-JSON aims to become:

- The **universal format** for POD product descriptions.
- The **bridge** between ecommerce, AI design tools, and print workflows.
- A **well-governed open standard** backed by real production use.

## Status

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as POD-JSON grows.
